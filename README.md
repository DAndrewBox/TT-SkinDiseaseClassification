# Since Github doesn't allow to upload more than 100mb per file, I uploaded the model (155mb) and the final dataset (2.9GB) to Google Drive.
Decompress the dataset on the `.\CompiledModels\HAM10000_VGG16_nadam_72acc_v2` folder as a folder called `HAM10000_images_draft_v1` if you want to test the model as it comes it the notebook.
